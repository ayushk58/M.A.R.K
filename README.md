Since M.A.R.K is still in development stage, the functions are pretty limited for now but soon will be able to start itself the moment the machine starts without any help from the user, It's functions would also be further included to

sending mail
GUI
details about weather
face recognition
open other apps than web browser and many more

The voice input is sometimes buggy as it's facing some difficulty while understanding Indian English, I am working on it and will release a whole new pleasent voice module soon enough :P

Also as JARVIS was capable of hacking through system, M.A.R.K too would be able to help in enumerating the machines with using tools such as Nmap,Gobuster,SMB enum,dig,FTP enum and more(Would include it in further releases)
